[[def: gram-head-neck, Gram head neck, Gram Head Neck, Neck]]

~ is the combined framing and cryptographic commitment portion that comes after the head and just before the payload. It often contains: Digest commitment to key state or attachments (d), Threshold parameters (kt, nt, etc.), Keys, witnesses, or configuration parameters.

~ Explanation: the Neck is where the cryptographic guts of the event get declared â€” it contains commitments that the verifier can later check (such as hashes of key sets, or anchors to prior events in the KEL).
